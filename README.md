# Table-Pagenation-and-Sorting-REACT

Here in this project I used a api link to fetch json data as entries using async function in react. 
In each page I'm showing 10 entries following next page button as well previous page and ascending or descending button.
Also I am counting the page number using useState hook.
I have stored the fetched datum into local storage and using them with useEffect hook.
I tried to make responsive the page with some css.
You can find the source codes in json-entries-table branch.
